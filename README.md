This project is a live demonstration of how coherence and ego could emerge from a simple behaviour.
The whole system is basically a reiterpretation of the 3-body problem, since any subject is induced to find the best balance between the world, the other subjects and itself.
Perhaps, it represents a graphical visualization of a simple informational problem. Several tools are provided, such as an coherence scoring, attention matrix, memory map and awareness. The "Egoic Resonance" plot represents the actual 3-body problem visualization.
