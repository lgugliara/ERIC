# ERIC

**ERIC** is a live demonstration of how **coherence and ego** can emerge from simple behavior.
The system reinterprets the **three-body problem**, where each subject continuously seeks balance between the **world, the other subjects, and itself**.

In this sense, ERIC acts as a **graphical visualization of an informational problem**.
Several tools are provided to explore its dynamics:

* **Coherence scoring** – measures the degree of internal consistency
* **Attention matrix** – shows the distribution of attention among subjects
* **Memory map** – visualizes memory density and structure
* **Awareness** – tracks the level of emergent self-awareness

At the core lies the **Egoic Resonance Plot**, a direct visualization of the three-body problem within an egoic framework.
