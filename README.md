# ERIC

**ERIC** is a live demonstration of how **coherence and ego** can emerge from simple behavior.
The system reinterprets the **three-body problem**, where each subject continuously seeks balance between the **world, the other subjects, and itself**.

In this sense, ERIC acts as a **graphical visualization of an informational problem**.
Several tools are provided to explore its dynamics:

* **Coherence scoring** – measures the degree of internal consistency
* **Attention matrix** – shows the distribution of attention among subjects
* **Memory map** – visualizes memory density and structure
* **Awareness** – tracks the level of emergent self-awareness

At the core lies the **Egoic Resonance Plot**, a direct visualization of the three-body problem within an egoic framework.

## Setup

Clone the repository and install the dependencies.

You can use the provided **requirements.txt**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or simply install the packages directly:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

Once installed, run the application with:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Technical Details

ERIC is not a traditional simulation, but a **conceptual model**.
It represents how **subjects** (abstract agents) can emerge into patterns of **coherence, resonance, and ego** through simple interactions.

The system can be thought of as:

* A reinterpretation of the **three-body problem**, applied to informational dynamics.
* A **balance-seeking process**, where each subject must constantly adjust between **the world, the others, and itself**.
* A **visual framework** to observe informational phenomena such as attention, memory, and awareness.

The visualization tools (coherence score, attention matrix, memory density map, egoic resonance plot) are not just metrics: they are **representations of how information organizes itself** under constraints of interaction and self-reference.

In this sense, ERIC is both a **scientific toy model** and a **metaphorical lens** on the emergence of ego and coherence.
